To help you get the most out of your week, this section containes a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Comet to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before arriving in San Diego. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

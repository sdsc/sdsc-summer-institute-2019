This is a parallel session, the attendees will choose their session based on their previous expertise in `git`:

* Introduction to the basics of `git` and Github in the Auditorium
* Advanced `git` and Github upstairs to _Synthesis Center E-B143_

### Introduction to `git`

Targeted at users with no or basic experience with `git`, it will cover the version control workflow, cloning a repository, create a repository on Github, push to the remote repository.

Detailed notes about the material for self-study later:

### Advanced `git`

You should be already familiar with creating Pull Requests on Github, merging and rebasing branches.
The class will be hands-on, we will go through a complex exercise together and answer questions as we go, see:

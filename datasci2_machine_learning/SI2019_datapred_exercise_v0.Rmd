##    PFR data prep exercises for data wrangling
## --------------------------------------------------

This is an R Markdown document for data prep exercises.

This exercise is to 'reshape' the data as an example of data wrangling/munging


##load data
```{r load data}
#use setwd("c:/your-path-to-your-project/data/")

W_df = read.table('weather_orig.csv',
                      header=TRUE,sep=",",
                      stringsAsFactors = TRUE)  #try TRUE
head(W_df)

```

##reshape data 
First, let's try installing this package.
'reshape' is in base R, but 'reshape2' is a newer version


```{r install (if necessary) and load reshape2}
if ("reshape2" %in% rownames(installed.packages())==FALSE)
  { install.packages('reshape2')
} else {print('reshape2 installed already')}
library("reshape2")

```


##reshape data 
Now, imagine that each day we want to list a measurement for each wind direction all in the same row.   You might think of it as doing linear regression where each factor level is it's own variable.

1. run this section and notice what the new row looks like,
Where are the new columns?

2. change the dcast formula to this:
               formula=Location~ WindGustDir,   
What's the difference?


```{r reshape long to wide, echo=TRUE}
library(reshape2)

# long to wide: ie 'cast' repeated measure into wide table
W_long   =dcast(W_df,  
              formula=Date+Location+ ...~ WindGustDir,   
                     #date, location and the rest are not repeated
                     #WindGustDir entries are labels for the repeated measures
               fill=0,     #this could be 0 or NA, for example.
               value.var="WindGustSpeed")   
                     #this variable has the repeated measurement values

head(W_long)
#optional: write.csv(W_cast,file='Weather_castwide.csv')

```



##reshape data wide to long
## Let's try to get back the original dataframe using the 'melt' command

1. Make sure the last version of W_long above has the first formula

2. Run this section of code to execute 'melt', first get the column numbers for the new columns

3. Notice that the dimensions are way off - what happened?

4. Go back to above section, rerun the dcast using fill=NA, then run this 'melt' code again - now what happened?


```{r get names, echo=TRUE}
#first get names of measured values
names(W_long)
#which columns have the measure values, what are their names and column number


```



```{r reshape wide to long, echo=TRUE}

# wide to long: ie 'melt' repeated measure into long table
W_melt   =melt(W_long,  na.rm=TRUE,
              measure.vars=c(23:39), 
                 #these variables have the repeated measurements 
              variable.name="WindGustDir_cast")    
                 #this varialbe distinguishes those measurements
                     
#if you want to resort records try:
#W_melt_ord = W_melt[ order(W_melt[,1], W_melt[,2]), ]

dim(W_melt)   
#OOPs what happend to the 2 rows, 

```



## Optional: fix the NAs
## ..

1. Make sure the last version of W_long above has the first formula
2. Run this code, notice the indices which have NA in them
3. Removing the NA in the Speed column are the bad measurements
4. The NA in the WindGustDir column are just bad labels!


```{r fixing NAs, echo=TRUE}

#try
#you can check which original row are NA
na_indices1  = which(is.na(W_df[,'WindGustDir']))
W_df[na_indices1,]

na_indices2  = which(is.na(W_df[,'WindGustSpeed']))
W_df[na_indices2,]


which(W_melt[,'WindGustDir_cast']=='NA')

W_df_nona=W_df[-na_indices1,]  #after this you could retry cast and melt


```
